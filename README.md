# LagrangeVander
A MATLAB Code to generate and validate the coefficients of a polynomial from a given set of variables 'x' and 'y'. The user inputs values of x and y and the code generates a Vandermode Matrix to solve for the coefficients of the polynomial whose degree is dependant on the number of inputs. Finally, an optional check can be conducted to verify the output with manual solutions.
